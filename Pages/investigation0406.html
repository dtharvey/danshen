<h2>Part II. Separating and Analyzing Mixtures Using HPLC with UV Detection</h2>
<h3>Investigations 4–6: UV Detection and Beer's Law</h3>
<p>The chromatogram in <a href="investigation0203.html#Fig1">Figure 1</a> was recorded using a UV detector. Figure 2 provides representative UV spectra from 220 nm to 380 nm for four of Danshen's constituents, two of which are lipophilic and two of which are hydrophilic; you may assume these spectra are representative of Danshen's other hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. Each spectrum is normalized so that its maximum absorbance is 1.00 [<a href="#Ref6">6</a>]. </p>

<p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 4.</strong> Based on Figure 2, are there features in these UV spectra that distinguish Danshen's hydrophilic compounds from its lipophilic compounds? What wavelength should we choose if our interest is the hydrophilic compounds only? What wavelength should we choose if our interest is the lipophilic compounds only? What is the best wavelength for detecting all of Danshen's constituents? </p>
<p>Although separating the analytes from each other is essential to the analysis, our ultimate goal is to determine each analyte's concentration in samples of Danshen. The height of each peak in a chromatogram is proportional to the corresponding analyte's concentration in the sample as injected.</p>
<p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 5.</strong> For a UV detector, what is the expected relationship between peak height and the analyte's concentration in μg/mL? For the results in <a href="investigation0203.html#FIg1">Figure 1</a>, can you assume the analyte with the smallest peak height is present at the lowest concentration [<a href="#Ref7">7</a>]? Why or why not? </p>
<p>The standard sample for the chromatogram in <a href="investigation0203.html#Fig1">Figure 1</a> was prepared by diluting 1.00 mL of a stock standard solution to 10.00 mL in a volumetric flask. Table 1 details the stock standard's preparation.</p>

<p class="investigation"><strong><a name="Invest6" id="Invest6"></a>Investigation 6.</strong> Calculate the concentration, in μg/mL, for each analyte in the standard sample whose chromatogram is shown in <a href="investigation0203.html#Fig1">Figure 1</a>. Using this standard sample as a single-point external standard, calculate for each analyte the proportionality constant  that relates its absorbance to its concentration in μg/mL [<a href="#Ref8">8</a>]. Do your results support your answer to Investigation 5? Why or why not?</p>
