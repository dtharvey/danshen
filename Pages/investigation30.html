<h2>Part VII. Verifying the Analytical Method's Accuracy</h2>
<h3>Investigation 30: Extraction Yield for Danshensu</h3>
<p>Let’s review our progress in developing a method for determining the concentration of hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds in Danshen. In <a href="investigation10.html">Part IV</a> we concluded that the optimum solvent is 80% methanol and 20% water (by volume), that the optimum extraction temperature is 70°C, and that the optimum microwave power is 800 W. In <a href="investigation1921.html">Part V</a> we determined that the extraction yields for danshensu, lithospermic acid, salvianolic acid A, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, and tanshinone IIA increase at longer extraction times and for larger solvent-to-solid ratios, and that the extraction yields for rosmarinic acid and for dihydrotanshinone are not affected significantly by variations in extraction time and the solvent-to-solid ratio. We also learned in <a href="investigation1921.html">Part V</a> that the analytes do not share a common optimum extraction time or solvent-to-solid ratio. Finally, in <a href="investigation26.html">Part VI</a> we used a global desirability function to show that an extraction time of 7.50 min, and a solvent-to-solid ratio of 35.0 mL/g allows for at least a 95% recovery of each analyte's optimum extraction yield. </p>
<p>Having optimized our method, we turn our attention to two additional crucial steps when developing an analytical method: verifying that the analytical method works and applying the method to a range of different samples. Here, in Part VII, we examine ways to verify our analytical method; in Part VIII we apply the analytical method to samples of Danshen from different natural locations and to samples from a controlled cultivation.</p>
<p>To verify our analytical method we need to show that the experimental extraction yields agree with the extraction yields predicted by the empirical models used to generate the response surfaces in <a href="investigation2425.html#Fig10">Figures 10–15</a>.</p>
<div class="investigation">
<p><strong><a name="Invest30" id="Invest30"></a>Investigation 30.</strong> In <a href="investigation1921.html">Part V</a> we found that the empirical model for the extraction of danshensu is</p>
<div class="equation">\[EY=0.575+0.0225A+0.00905B-0.00125{ A }^{ 2 }-0.000165{ B }^{ 2 }+0.000100AB\]</div>
<p>where <em>EY</em> is the extraction yield (in mg/g), <em>A</em> is the extraction time (in min), and <em>B</em> is the solvent-to-solid ratio (in mL/g). Using this model, calculate danshensu's predicted extraction yield for an extraction time of 7.50 min and a solvent-to-solid ratio of 35.0 mL/g. Is your predicted extraction yield consistent with the data in <a href="investigation1921.html#Table2">Table 2</a> and your response to <a href="investigation2425.html#Invest25">Investigation 25</a>?</p>
