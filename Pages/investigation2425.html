<h2>Part V. Optimizing the Solvent-to-Solid Ratio and the Extraction Time</h2>
<h3>Investigations 24-25: Modeling the Effect of Solvent-to-Solid Ratio and Extraction Time on Extraction Yield of Other Analytes</h3>
<p>The regression equation from <a href="investigation2223.html">Investigations 22 and 23</a> describes the empirical model of danshensu's extraction yield for extraction times in the range 2.18–7.82 min and for solvent-to-solid ratios in the range 10.9–39.1 mL/g. Nevertheless, it is difficult to look at the equation and predict the extraction time and the solvent-to-solid ratio that maximizes danshensu's extraction yield; it is difficult, as well, to look at the regression equation and determine how sensitive is the optimum extraction yield to a small change in extraction time or solvent-to-solid ratio.</p>
<p>The factor levels that give the optimum extraction yield and the sensitivity of the extraction yield to a small change in factor levels are easier to visualize if we display the results as a three-dimensional plot (or a pseudo-3D plot) with extraction yield on the <em>z</em>-axis and extraction time and the solvent-to-solid ratio on the <em>x</em>-axis and the <em>y</em>-axis, respectively. <a name="Fig10" id="Fig10"></a>Figure 10 is one such a plot, which overlays a contour map of equivalent extraction yields on a heatmap that displays extraction yields using a variation in color. We call this type of plot a response surface.</p>

<p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 24.</strong> Does Figure 10 agree with your results from <a href="investigation1921.html#Invest21">Investigation 21</a> and <a href="investigation2223.html#Invest23">Investigation 23</a>? Why or why not? Estimate the optimum conditions for maximizing danshensu's extraction yield and explain your reasoning. How sensitive is the optimum extraction yield to a small change in extraction time? How sensitive is the optimum extraction yield to a small change in the solvent-to-solid ratio?</p>
<p>Figures 11-15 show response surfaces for lithospermic acid, salvianolic acid A, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, and tanshinone IIA, each based on a regression analysis of data similar to that in <a href="investigation1921.html#Table2">Table 2</a> for danshensu. The regression models for rosmarinic acid and for dihydrotanshinone are not significant, although the extraction of rosmarinic acid increases slightly for larger solvent-to-solid ratios and the extraction of dihydrotanshinone decreases slightly at longer extraction times; we will assume, however, that their extraction yields are independent of the extraction time and the solvent-to-solid ratio, with values of 2.317 mg/g for rosmarinic acid and 0.424 mg/g for dihydrotanshinone.</p>

<p class="investigation"><strong><a name="Invest25" id="Invest25"></a>Investigation 25.</strong> Using Figures 11–15, determine the optimum extraction time and solvent-to-solid ratio for lithospermic acid, salvianolic acid A, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, and tanshinone IIA. How sensitive is the extraction of each analyte to a small change in the optimum extraction time and in the optimum solvent-to-solid ratio? Considering your responses here and to Investigation 24, are there combinations of extraction times and solvent-to-solid ratios that will optimize the extraction yield for all six of these analytes?</p>
