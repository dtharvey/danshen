<h2>Part II. Separating and Analyzing Mixtures Using HPLC with UV Detection</h2>
<h3>Investigations 2 and 3: Reverse-Phase HPLC and Order of Elution of Solutes</h3>
<p>The analysis of a complex mixture usually is carried out using some form of chromatography, which allows us to separate the mixture's components prior to their individual detection. The sample is injected into a mobile phase that moves through a column containing a stationary phase. A component of the mixture that interacts more strongly with the stationary phase takes longer to pass through the column and reach the detector, eluting at a later time than a component that interacts less strongly with the stationary phase. The resulting chromatogram consists of a series of peaks, each characterized by a retention time (<em>t</em><sub>r</sub>) and a peak height (or peak area) [<a href="#Ref4">4</a>].</p>
<p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 2</strong>. For this study we will use a reverse-phase HPLC equipped with a UV detector to monitor absorbance. What is a reverse-phase separation and how is it different from a normal-phase separation? How does the choice between a reverse-phase separation and a normal-phase separation affect the order in which analytes elute from an HPLC?</p>
<p><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a>Figure 1 shows a reverse-phase HPLC chromatogram for a standard mixture of the eight main components of Danshen. The column contains a non-polar C18 stationary phase. The mobile phase is a gradient of acetonitrile and an aqueous solution of 0.04% (v/v) phosphoric acid, beginning at 15% acetonitrile and ending at 80% acetonitrile, by volume. The flow rate is 0.80 mL/min. The elution order is danshensu, rosmarinic acid, lithospermic acid, salvianolic acid A, dihydrotanshinone, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, and tanshinone IIA [<a href="#Ref5">5</a>].</p>

<p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 3</strong>. Using the data in Figure 1 determine each analyte&rsquo;s retention time. Based on your answers to <a href="investigation01.html#Invest1">Investigation 1</a> and Investigation 2, does the relative order of elution  make sense? Why or why not? </p>

<p><a name="Ref5" id="Ref5"></a>[5] The data sets in this exercise are based  on work described in the paper "Simultaneous extraction of hydrosoluble phenolic acids and liposoluble tanshinones from <em>Salvia miltiorrhiza radix</em> by an optimized microwave-assisted extraction method,"; the full reference for which is Fang, X.; Wang, J.; Zhang, S.; Zhao, Q.; Zheng, Z.; and Song, Z. <em>Sep. Purif. Technol</em>. <strong>2012</strong>, <em>86</em>, 149-156 (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2011.10.039">DOI</a>).</p> 
<p>Although some data in this exercise are drawn directly from or extrapolated from data in the original paper, other data are generated artificially or drawn from these additional sources: "Simultaneous quantification of six major phenolic acids in the roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza and four related tradition-al Chinese medicinal preparations by HPLC-DAD method,” the full reference for which is Liu, A; Li, L; Xu, M.; Lin, Y.; Guo, H.; Guo, D. <em>J.

Anal.</em> <strong>2006</strong>, <em>41</em>, 48–56 (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2005.10.021">DOI</a>); and "Simultaneous Determination of Seven Active Compounds in Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae by Temperature-Controlled Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction and HPLC," the full reference for which is Qu, H.; Zhai, X.; Shao, Q.; Cheng, Y. <em>Chromatographa</em> <strong>2007</strong>, <em>66</em>, 21–27. (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1365/s10337-007-0244-4">DOI</a>).</p>
<p>The original paper also includes data for the extraction and analysis of salvianolic acid B; because its concentration in Danshen is an order of magnitude greater than Danshen&rsquo;s other constituents, it complicates the presentation of data and is not included in this case study.</p>
