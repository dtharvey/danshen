<h2>Part IV. Optimizing the Solvent, Temperature, and Microwave Power</h2>
<h3>Investigation 15: Optimizing the Temperature (Part A)</h3>
<p>In <a href="investigation14.html#Invest14">Investigation 14</a> we found that the optimum solvent  is 80% methanol and 20% water (by volume) when extracting a 3.00-g sample of Danshen for 5.00 min using 60.0 mL of solvent at a temperature of 60Â°C and a microwave power of 800 W. Next, we turn our attention to optimizing the  temperature of our solvent extraction.</p>
<p>In general, increasing the solvent's temperature improves the solvent's extraction efficiency, although an excessively high temperature may decompose the sample and destroy some or all of its constituent compounds.</p>
<p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 15.</strong> Propose a set of experiments that will effectively and efficiently allow you to optimize the extraction temperature using the solvent selected in <a href="investigation1114.html#Invest14">Investigation 14</a>. What range of temperatures will you explore? How many samples will you run? Explain the reasons for the range of temperatures and the number of samples you selected.</p>
